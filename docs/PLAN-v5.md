# Sentinels v5 — Autofix: deterministic remediation and GitHub pull requests

> **Status:** written 2026-08-11, on branch `complete-auto-fix` (cut from
> `sliding-effect`, which is 8 commits ahead of `main` — `main` predates all of v4).
>
> Same discipline as [`PLAN-v3.md`](PLAN-v3.md) and [`PLAN-v4.md`](PLAN-v4.md): small,
> independently verifiable stages; **do not start N+1 until N passes its verification**;
> one short learning note per stage (`docs/learning/`), per [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md).
>
> **This document is the specification.** If implementation reality conflicts with it,
> the conflict gets confirmed and *this file* gets updated — the architecture is never
> silently changed to route around a surprise.
>
> Stage 0 done, 2026-08-11. Migration `(10, _V10_SCHEMA)` adds `users`, `sessions`,
> `github_installations`, and `scans.user_id`/`scans.commit_sha`. `backend/auth/`
> (new): `session.py` (signed cookie mint/verify/expiry), `github_oauth.py`
> (GitHub as identity provider — a token is used once to read identity, then
> discarded, never stored), `deps.py` (`current_user`/`optional_user`). Four new
> routes: `GET /auth/github/{login,callback}`, `GET /auth/me`, `POST /auth/logout`.
> Every existing route except `/`, `/health`, `/agents`, `/repo/agents` now requires
> `Depends(current_user)`; `DELETE /scans/{id}` additionally checks ownership (403 on
> someone else's scan). `save_scan`/`run_scan`/`run_repo_scan` gained an additive,
> defaulted `user_id` — every prior caller and test is unaffected. Frontend:
> `app/login/page.tsx`, `lib/useSession.ts`, `credentials: "include"` (fetch) /
> `withCredentials: true` (EventSource) on every backend call, shared 401→`/login`
> redirect centralized in `lib/api.ts`. 137 tests green (36 new, `test_auth.py`);
> manually verified end to end with `TestClient` — no cookie → 401, public routes
> stay open, sign-in → protected routes serve, logout revokes immediately.
> `tsc --noEmit` clean. Note:

> Stage A done, 2026-08-12. New package `backend/remediation/`: `base.py` (`Fixer`
> ABC), `source.py` (`FileSource` — current file content + blob SHA from GitHub's
> Contents API, independent of `repo/fetch.py`'s tarball), `patch.py` (`build_diff`/
> `make_patch`/`validate_plan` — the single safety gate), `tiers.py` (ID-prefix → tier
> table), `budget.py` (`MAX_FILES_PER_PR` etc.), `registry.py` (`fixer_for`),
> `planning.py` (orchestrates one plan/preview/bundle request). Four fixers: `workflows.py`
> (pins `ci-unpinned-action-*` to a commit SHA — pure line-rewrite tested separately from
> the network SHA resolver, per conflict #3), `gitignore.py` (`gitignore-present`,
> creates only), `scaffolding.py` (`repo-readme-present` and `repo-env-example-present`,
> both creates-only — the latter refuses to plan anything when no committed `.env`
> exists to read variable names from, never inventing them), `dockerfile.py`
> (`docker-root-user-*`, tier 2, base-image-aware `USER` insertion before the *last*
> `CMD`/`ENTRYPOINT`, never trusting the finding's placeholder `line=1`). Migration
> `(11, _V11_SCHEMA)` adds `fix_plans` (written by this stage), `fix_applications` and
> `audit_log` (schema-ready, unwritten until Stage B — same precedent `repo_files`/V7 set).
> New models in `backend/models.py`: `FilePatch`, `FixPlan`, `FixApplicationState`,
> `FixApplication`. Three endpoints: `GET /scans/{id}/findings/{key}/fix/plan` (live
> preview, never persisted), `POST /scans/{id}/fix/plan` (plans + saves a batch,
> per-key `fixable` result), `GET /scans/{id}/fix/bundle.zip` (every saved plan's diffs,
> zipped). Frontend: `FixPlanPanel.tsx` renders above the existing `FixSuggestionPanel`
> on repo-scan findings, gated by a new `isRepoScan` prop on `FindingRow` (a URL scan
> has no file to patch). Fixed in passing: `lib/agents.ts`'s `fetchAgentResult` was
> missing `credentials: "include"`, a Stage-0 gap that silently 401ed the agent detail
> page — where this panel lives — for every signed-in user; found and fixed during this
> stage's own live verification. 233 tests green (96 new, `tests/test_remediation_*.py`
> + `test_storage_remediation.py`), all offline/mocked except one manual live run against
> a real public repo (`octocat/Hello-World`) that planned, saved, and bundled a real
> `.gitignore` fix end to end, and one full browser pass (seeded session cookie, real
> scan, click-through of preview → save → download bundle, confirmed via network log).

>   root, not `backend/` — so `backend/.env` was silently never found when run via

>   configured" despite a correctly filled-in `.env`). Now loads

>   introduced by Stage B; just first surfaced by it.
> - **Known gap, not fixed:** the install callback redirects to
>   `{frontend}/settings?installed=...`, and no `/settings` page exists in the
>   Next.js app yet — a real 404 in the browser, harmless (the backend write
>   still completes and was confirmed via direct DB read), but confusing during
>   manual testing. Building that page is frontend work for whenever Stage B gets
>   wired to the UI, not part of this stage's scope.

>   work still becomes `verified`, with `target_fixed=false` carrying the
>   result — otherwise it would sit in `merged` forever, indistinguishable from

## The problem

Sentinels ends at advice. A finding goes to Groq and comes back as six paragraphs of
prose (`FixSuggestion`, `backend/models.py`). Nothing machine-actionable exists anywhere:
no file path, no diff, no target. `framework_examples` is the closest thing, and it is
free text a model invented.

## The shape of the answer

```
Finding → deterministic FixPlan → diff preview → explicit approval
       → branch + commit + PR → user merges → re-verify → PASS + score delta
```

## The governing rule

**The LLM never writes the patch.** Deterministic Python fixers produce the code change;
the LLM keeps writing only the English. This is the existing law of this codebase
("Scoring stays deterministic — no model in the loop. The AI layer only *enriches*")
extended to remediation. See CLAUDE.md's remediation non-negotiable for all ten rules.

---

## Fixability tiers

| Tier | Meaning | UI reads | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Deterministic, safe to PR | **Fix available** | `ci-unpinned-action-*`, `gitignore-present`, `repo-readme-present`, `repo-env-example-present` |
| 2 | Generated, human must check | **Review required** | `docker-root-user-*`, `dependency-*`, `docker-latest-tag-*`, `secret-env-committed-*`, `ci-pull-request-target-*`, `api-cors-permissive`, `sensitive-response-cacheable`, `server-version-disclosed`, `risky-http-methods` |
| 3 | We can say exactly what to do, we cannot do it | **Manual action required** | `spf-record`, `dmarc-record`, `tls-*`, `dir-listing`, `env-file-exposed`, `git-directory-exposed`, `backup-file-exposed`, `setup-page-exposed` |
| 4 | Never auto-fix | **Suggestion only** | `pattern-*`, `subdomain-takeover-potential`, `subdomain-dangling-dns`, `*-scan-partial`, anything with `confidence` set |

`LICENSE` is deliberately **not** auto-generated. Choosing a software license is a legal
decision, not a security fix.

## Conflicts found during inspection

Recorded here because each one changed the design:

1. **No auth exists anywhere.** No user model, no session, no `Depends()` — 21 open
   endpoints behind a CORS allowlist, which `curl` ignores. Adding repo-write capability
   to that is unacceptable, so **Stage 0 exists** and lands before everything else.
2. **`actions/checkout@v4` can never produce a finding** — `agents/repo/config.py` skips
   `owner in ("actions","github")`. The pinning fixer targets **third-party actions only**;
   the test repo must contain one.
3. **Tag → SHA resolution needs the network.** Split into a pure line-rewrite function
   (offline-testable) plus a resolver (mocked in tests). Determinism holds: same tag,
   same SHA, no model involved.
4. **Finding IDs are lossy.** `file_slug = path.replace("/","-")` is non-injective and can
   collide. Fixers route on ID prefix but **read `Finding.file_path`** — never parse the ID.
5. **The repo tarball is deleted** (`repo/fetch.py` `shutil.rmtree`) and no file content is
   stored. Fixers must re-fetch — which is how drift protection comes for free.
6. **`_finalize` only INSERTs**; scans are immutable history. Verification must not mutate
   the original scan.
7. **`gitignore-present` lives in `config.py`**, not `hygiene.py`, and carries no `file_path`.
8. **`scans` stores no commit SHA**, so a re-plan can silently target a different commit
   than the scan saw. Fixed by a column in migration 10.
9. **`fix_plans` is `INSERT OR REPLACE`d on every re-plan** (`storage/remediation.py`),
   so a re-plan gives the row a *new* autoincrement id. `fix_applications.fix_plan_id`
   was `NOT NULL REFERENCES fix_plans(id) ON DELETE CASCADE` — a re-plan of an already-
   applied finding would have cascade-deleted its `fix_applications` row, silently
   destroying audit history for a PR that might still be open or already merged. Fixed
   in migration 12: `fix_applications` gets its own frozen `plan_json` snapshot and the
   FK becomes nullable/`ON DELETE SET NULL` — an audit row must never depend on a plan
   row surviving.
10. **No GitHub App *installation* flow exists.** `github_installations` (migration 10)
    has zero reads or writes anywhere — Stage 0 only built the *sign-in* half
    (`auth/github_oauth.py`: read identity once, discard the token). Stage B cannot
    mint an installation token without first knowing which installation belongs to
    which user's which repo, so a small install-linking flow (§Stage B) has to exist
    before `tokens.py` has anything to mint against.
11. **The drift re-check needs the installation token too.** Stage B's step order
    below mints the token at step 9, immediately before the first write, with the
    step-5 drift re-check reading through `source.get_file` unauthenticated. That
    breaks on a private repository: an unauthenticated Contents API call 404s, and
    the drift check would honestly but *wrongly* report "the file was deleted".
    Resolved by minting the token right after the installation lookup and using it
    for the reads as well — minting writes nothing, so `dry_run` still touches no
    state, and step 7 still stops before the first write. Recorded here rather than
    silently reordered.

## Stage 0 — Identity and access

Everything downstream needs to know *who* is asking: the audit log's "who", which user an
App installation belongs to, and who may write to a repo. GitHub is the identity provider —
the same App registered for autofix also provides "Sign in with GitHub", so there are no
passwords, no reset flow, no `bcrypt`.

**Migration `(10, _V10_SCHEMA)`** — appended to `db.py`'s `MIGRATIONS`, never editing an
existing entry:

- `users` — github_id, github_login, avatar_url, created_at, last_seen_at
- `sessions` — token_hash, user_id FK CASCADE, created_at, expires_at
- `github_installations` — installation_id, user_id FK, account_login, repo_selection,
  permissions_json, created_at, revoked_at
- `scans.user_id` (nullable — pre-auth scans stay readable as legacy/unowned)
- `scans.commit_sha` (conflict #8)

**Added:** `backend/auth/{session,github_oauth,deps}.py`, `backend/storage/users.py`.

Session is a signed, HTTP-only, SameSite=Lax cookie — stdlib `hmac` + `secrets`, constant-
time compare, explicit expiry. Only the token *hash* is stored, so a leaked DB does not
yield usable sessions. **No new dependency in this stage** (`PyJWT`/`cryptography` arrive
in Stage B, where installation-token signing actually needs them).

**Endpoints:** `GET /auth/github/login`, `GET /auth/github/callback`, `GET /auth/me`,
`POST /auth/logout`. Every existing route except `/`, `/health`, `/agents`, `/repo/agents`
gains `Depends(current_user)`. `GET /scans` returns the caller's scans plus legacy ones.

**Frontend:** `app/login/page.tsx`, `lib/useSession.ts`, `credentials: "include"` on every
fetch in `lib/api.ts`, shared 401 → `/login`. CORS gains `allow_credentials=True`.

**Verification:** session sign/verify/expiry/tamper tests; protected route returns 401
without a cookie and 200 with one; the existing 101 tests stay green.
**Note:** `learning/58-sign-in-with-github-and-sessions.md`.

## Stage A — The patch layer (writes nothing, anywhere)

**New package `backend/remediation/`**, mirroring `backend/agents/`:

- `base.py` — `Fixer` ABC: `slug`, `handles(finding) -> bool`, `plan(finding, files) -> FixPlan | None`
- `registry.py` — ordered `FIXERS` list + `fixer_for(finding)`
- `patch.py` — `difflib.unified_diff` generation, `FilePatch` construction, `validate_plan()`
- `tiers.py` — ID-prefix → tier table
- `source.py` — current file content + blob SHA from GitHub (the drift anchor)
- `budget.py` — `MAX_FILES_PER_PR = 10`, `MAX_PRS_PER_SCAN = 3`, `MAX_PRS_PER_HOUR = 10`,
  as readable constants at the top, mirroring `agents/probe.py`'s `Budget` style

**Fixers:** `workflows.py` (`ci-unpinned-action-*`, certain), `gitignore.py`
(`gitignore-present`, certain, creates only), `scaffolding.py` (`repo-readme-present`,
`repo-env-example-present`, certain, `.env.example` keys blanked never valued),
`dockerfile.py` (`docker-root-user-*`, **review-required**, base-image detection,
insertion point found before the last `CMD`/`ENTRYPOINT` rather than trusting the
finding's placeholder `line=1`).

**Models:** `FilePatch`, `FixPlan`, `FixApplication`, `FixApplicationState`
(`planned | pr_open | merged | verified | failed | abandoned`).

**`validate_plan()` is the single safety gate** — one small testable function every plan
passes through, rather than trusting seven fixers to each be careful: tier permits
application; `len(patches) <= MAX_FILES_PER_PR`; no path traversal, no absolute paths, no
writes under `.git/`; `action="delete"` only for an explicit secret-file allowlist; every
touched path traces back to the originating finding.

**Migration `(11, _V11_SCHEMA)`** — `fix_plans`, `fix_applications`, `audit_log`.
**Storage:** `backend/storage/remediation.py`.
**Endpoints:** `GET /scans/{id}/findings/{key}/fix/plan`, `POST /scans/{id}/fix/plan`,
`GET /scans/{id}/fix/bundle.zip`.

**Frontend:** `FixSuggestionPanel` is *extended, not replaced* — the existing "Fix with AI"
button stays. A new `FixPlanPanel` renders above it when a deterministic fixer exists, with
a tier badge, a diff view, and Copy / Download Patch.

**Verification:** every fixer unit-tested offline (happy path, missing file, already-fixed,
malformed input, duplicate instruction); `validate_plan` rejection tests; diff generation
tests. Nothing in this stage touches GitHub.
**Notes:** `59-deterministic-fixers-and-unified-diffs.md`, `60-the-diff-preview-ui.md`.

## Stage B — GitHub writes

Designed 2026-08-12 (audited against the actual Stage A code, not just this document —
see conflicts #9–10); **required invariants below are non-negotiable for this stage**,
not optional hardening, per explicit sign-off:

> 1. `fix_applications.plan_json` is an immutable snapshot of the exact `FixPlan` applied
>    — the audit record, independent of `fix_plans` ever changing or disappearing.
> 2. `fix_applications.fix_plan_id` is nullable, `ON DELETE SET NULL` — a live-plan
>    reference when convenient, never something an audit row's survival depends on.
> 3. **Strict ownership, no exception:** `POST /scans/{id}/fix/apply` requires
>    `scan.user_id == authenticated_user.id`. Unlike `DELETE /scans/{id}` (which treats a
>    legacy unowned scan as fair game for any signed-in user), an unowned scan can
>    **never** be applied — there is no one whose installation it would even use.
> 4. **Installation ownership is checked independently of scan ownership** — an active
>    (`revoked_at IS NULL`) `github_installations` row belonging to `authenticated_user.id`
>    whose `account_login` matches the target repo's owner. Both checks must pass; neither
>    substitutes for the other.

### Two things this stage has to build that PLAN-v5 previously assumed already existed

**Installation linking** (conflict #10) — a flow distinct from sign-in, since a user can
sign in without ever granting repo-write access:

- `GET /auth/github/install` — mints a signed `state`, redirects to
  `https://github.com/apps/<app-slug>/installations/new`.
- `GET /auth/github/install/callback?installation_id&setup_action&state` — verifies
  `state` against the session (CSRF, same pattern as `auth/github_oauth.py`'s login
  flow), then persists a `github_installations` row. No OAuth token round-trip needed to
  "verify" the installation belongs to this user: GitHub only ever redirects here after
  the signed-in-on-github.com user themselves completed the install/authorize screen for
  that installation, and the `state` match ties that redirect to *this* Sentinels session.
- `GET /installations` — the caller's linked installations (for a "connect a repo" UI).
- `POST /installations/{id}/revoke` — soft-revoke on our side (`revoked_at`); the real
  revocation still happens on GitHub's side, independently, whenever the user chooses.

**`backend/storage/installations.py`** (new) — CRUD for `github_installations`: save on
callback, look up by `(user_id, account_login)`, mark revoked. Nothing here yet.

### Added

`remediation/tokens.py` — `TokenProvider` ABC; `AppTokenProvider` mints ~1h installation
tokens from a JWT (RS256, `iss=app_id`, ~9min exp) signed with the App's private key,
via `POST /app/installations/{id}/access_tokens`; `DevTokenProvider` reads
`SENTINELS_GITHUB_DEV_TOKEN` and **refuses to run unless `SENTINELS_ALLOW_DEV_TOKEN=1`**.
First new dependencies since Stage 0: `PyJWT`, `cryptography`.

`remediation/github.py` — Git Data API, no local clone: base ref (reuses Stage A's
`source.resolve_ref_sha` — the commits endpoint already accepts a branch name) → one
`git/blobs` call per changed file → one `git/trees` call (base tree + new blobs) → one
`git/commits` call (one parent) → one `git/refs` call (create the branch pointing at that
commit) → one `pulls` call. One commit, one PR, however many files.

`remediation/pr_body.py` — deterministic title/body template. Always states, per finding:
what was fixed, and **what it does not fix** (secret removal never rotates or erases
history — CLAUDE.md rule 9) — assembled from data already on the `Finding`/`FixPlan`,
never from a model.

`remediation/apply.py` — the one place that calls `github.py`, mirroring `planning.py`'s
role for the plan endpoints. Order of operations for `apply(scan, finding_keys, dry_run)`:

1. Ownership check (invariant #3) → installation lookup (invariant #4).
2. Idempotency check — an existing **non-terminal** `fix_applications` row per requested
   `finding_key`. All-already-applied → return the existing PR, not a new one.
   Mixed (some applied, some new) → reject the batch rather than silently splitting it.
3. Re-run `validate_plan()` per finding — never trust a stored plan just because it
   passed once.
4. Cross-plan batch check (new, beyond Stage A's single-plan `validate_plan`): total
   files across the *whole* selection ≤ `MAX_FILES_PER_PR`; no two plans touch the same
   path.
5. Drift re-check — re-fetch every unique path's blob SHA via `source.get_file`, compare
   to `original_sha`. **Any** mismatch aborts the **entire batch**, before any write.
6. `MAX_PRS_PER_SCAN` / `MAX_PRS_PER_HOUR` budget check (constants exist since Stage A,
   unenforced until now).
7. `dry_run=True` stops here — returns repo, branch name, files, diffs, commit message,
   PR title/body. Nothing written. The live path is not wired to the frontend until dry
   run is boring against a throwaway repo.
8. Branch name validated against `^sentinels/fix-[0-9a-f]{8}-\d+$` and checked against
   the repo's `default_branch` before the first write call — defense in depth even
   though the prefix should make collision structurally impossible.
9. Mint token → the Git Data API sequence above → one PR.
10. Write one `fix_applications` row per finding (`state="pr_open"`, `plan_json` snapshot)
    + `audit_log` rows. On PR-creation failure after the branch ref was already created:
    best-effort `DELETE .../git/refs/heads/{branch}` so a failed apply never leaves an
    orphan branch sitting in the user's repo.

**`POST /scans/{id}/fix/apply`** — body `{finding_keys: list[str], dry_run: bool}`.
**`GET /scans/{id}/fix/applications`** — lists a scan's `fix_applications`; any row still
`pr_open` gets a live `GET .../pulls/{number}` on read, updating state to `merged`/closed
as GitHub reports it — Stage C trusts this field, so it has to be accurate, not just
"we haven't checked."

The installation token is also passed to `repo/fetch.py`, lifting GitHub's ceiling from 60
to 5000 requests/hour — verification re-downloads the tarball each run and would otherwise
hit the unauthenticated wall mid-demo.

### DB — migration `(12, _V12_SCHEMA)`

```sql
ALTER TABLE fix_applications ADD COLUMN plan_json TEXT;   -- backfilled NOT NULL going forward
-- fix_plan_id's FK behavior changes from ON DELETE CASCADE to ON DELETE SET NULL
-- (SQLite can't ALTER a FK in place -- rebuilt via the standard
-- create-new-table/copy/drop/rename sequence, same as any SQLite FK change)
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_fix_applications_active
    ON fix_applications(scan_id, finding_key)
    WHERE state NOT IN ('failed', 'abandoned');
```

The partial unique index is the DB-level backstop for the idempotency check in `apply.py`
step 2 — belt and suspenders, not a replacement for the application-level check (which
gives a much better error message).

### Verification

GitHub failure injection (401, 403, 404, branch-already-exists, PR-creation failure,
commit failure — all against a mocked transport, same as Stage A's tests) for every step
of `github.py` and `tokens.py`; `apply.py` tests for both required invariants (ownership
rejection, installation-ownership rejection), idempotency (repeat call, mixed-selection
rejection), drift-abort (whole batch), budget rejection, orphan-branch cleanup on
PR-creation failure. Migration 12 applies cleanly on top of an existing v11 DB and the
partial index actually rejects a duplicate active row. Then a real PR against a
throwaway repo — **the flow is not reported as working until that PR URL exists**.
**Notes:** `61-github-apps-and-installation-tokens.md`, `62-committing-without-a-clone.md`.

---

## Stage C — Verification

`POST /scans/{id}/findings/{key}/verify` re-runs **only** the responsible agent:
`parse_github_url` → `fetch_repo` → `list_repo_files` → `AgentClass().run(ctx)`. No
`_finalize`, no new scan row, the original scan untouched.

Score delta substitutes that agent's fresh findings into the stored report and calls the
**unmodified** `scoring.calculate_score`. Response: `{before, after, delta, fixed[],
still_failing[]}`, recorded on the `fix_applications` row (`state → verified`).

Needs a `{cls.name: cls}` lookup on both registries (neither has one). State transitions
validated: `planned → pr_open → merged → verified`, with `failed`/`abandoned` reachable
from anywhere; anything else raises.
**Note:** `63-verifying-a-fix-and-the-score-delta.md`.

---

## Stage D — the URL → repo bridge

A URL scan's four header findings (`missing-csp`, `missing-hsts`,
`missing-x-content-type-options`, `missing-x-frame-options`, `agents/headers.py`) have
no `file_path` — there's no repository to patch, just a site. Every Fixer built so far
assumes a repo scan, whose own GitHub URL already tells `FileSource` where to read.
Stage D lets a user tell Sentinels which repository *serves* a URL scan's site, so
these four findings get the same deterministic-fix treatment everything else does.

**Scoped down from the original one-line deferred note** (Next.js + Vercel only;
netlify.toml/nginx.conf are a later stage) after three questions confirmed in chat
2026-08-13: link by picking an already-installed App installation (no new GitHub
permission flow, no repo-listing API call — the user types the repo name under an
account they've already granted access to); fix the header findings' tier as part of
this stage, since they're only reachable once this stage exists.

### Conflict #12 — a finding with no `file_path` needs a different anchor for "traces back to the finding"

`patch.py`'s `validate_plan()` enforces one thing above all: a plan may only touch the
path the finding named. For a finding with no `file_path` (every header finding, since
`Finding.file_path` is documented as always `None` for a URL-scan finding — an
invariant this stage does not touch, since mutating it would blur "which findings came
from observing the live site" for every downstream reader), the existing rule only
ever permits `action="create"`. That's wrong for Stage D: fixing a header on a site
that already has a `vercel.json` or `next.config.ts` means *modifying* it, not creating
a second one.

Resolved the same way `DELETE_ALLOWLIST` resolves "which paths may ever be deleted": a
small, named, closed table — `LINK_REPO_FIXER_PATHS: dict[str, frozenset[str]]`, keyed
by `FixPlan.fixer_slug` — of the only paths that fixer is ever allowed to touch when
the originating finding named none. `security-headers` maps to exactly
`{"next.config.js", "next.config.ts", "next.config.mjs", "vercel.json"}`. A finding
with a `file_path` is completely unaffected; this is a new branch, not a loosened one.

### Data model

**Migration `(14, _V14_SCHEMA)`** — one table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE scan_repo_links (
    scan_id          TEXT PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES scans(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id          INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    installation_id  INTEGER NOT NULL,
    owner            TEXT NOT NULL,
    repo             TEXT NOT NULL,
    ref              TEXT,                   -- NULL = the repo's own default branch
    linked_at        TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

One link per scan (`scan_id` is the primary key) — a URL scan targets one site, so at
most one repository is ever "the thing that serves it." Linking again replaces the
row. New model `ScanRepoLink`; new `storage/scan_links.py` (save/get/delete, delete
scoped to `user_id` the same way `revoke_installation` scopes to its caller).

### `remediation/linking.py` — one resolver, three callers

`planning.py`, `apply.py`, and `verify.py` each used to call
`parse_github_url(report.url)` directly — correct for a repo scan, meaningless for a
URL scan (`report.url` is a website, not a GitHub URL). `repo_target(report) -> (owner,
repo, ref)` centralizes the branch: a repo scan still parses its own URL; a URL scan
reads `scan_repo_links`, raising `NoRepoTarget` (a `ValueError`, so every existing
`except ValueError` catch site needs no change) when nothing is linked yet. `ref` is
`None` when nothing pins one down, meaning "the repository's own default branch" to
every caller, same as today.

### `remediation/stack.py` — detecting what serves the site

`detect_stack(files: FileSource) -> StackResult | None` probes, in order:
`vercel.json`, then `next.config.ts` / `next.config.js` / `next.config.mjs`. Vercel
first: platform-level headers apply regardless of framework, so when both exist the
deployment's edge network is the layer actually setting the header. `None` means
neither was found — the fixer declines rather than guessing at an unrecognized stack,
same honesty rule as every other tier-4 fallback.

### `remediation/headers_fix.py` — `SecurityHeaderFixer`

One Fixer (`slug = "security-headers"`, tier 2 — generated, human must check) handling
all four `missing-*` header findings, dispatching on the detected stack:

- **`vercel.json`** — the safe general case: structured JSON, no case where a change
  can't be expressed as data. Parses (`json.loads`; malformed JSON → declines, never
  guesses), finds or creates a `headers` array entry for `source: "/(.*)"`, adds the
  missing header key/value if not already present (already present → `None`, nothing
  left to fix), re-serializes with `json.dumps(indent=2)`.
- **`next.config.*`** — deliberately narrower, because safely rewriting an arbitrary
  JS/TS object literal without an AST parser is not something to guess at:
  - no `next.config.*` exists → **create** one with a minimal `headers()` export
    covering all four headers in one entry.
  - one exists with no `headers(` substring anywhere in it → **modify**: insert an
    `async headers()` property right after the exported object's opening `{`, found
    via a regex anchored on `module.exports = {` / `export default { ` / `const
    <name>(: NextConfig)? = {` — the same "find an anchor, insert there" shape
    `dockerfile.py`'s `USER` insertion already uses. No anchor found → declines.
  - one exists **and already defines `headers()`** → declines. Merging into an
    unknown, already-authored headers function is exactly the kind of guess this
    project's confidence rule forbids; a human editing four lines by hand is safer
    than Sentinels reformatting a function it can't fully parse.

Registered in `registry.py`'s `FIXERS`; the four header ids move from unlisted
(silently tier 4) to `tiers.py`'s `_EXACT_TIER` at tier 2 — the actual correction this
stage's third confirmed question asked for.

### Endpoints

`POST /scans/{id}/link-repo` `{installation_id, repo, ref?}` — 400 if the scan isn't a
URL scan, 403 if the scan isn't the caller's or the installation isn't a live one they
hold; `owner` comes from the installation's own `account_login`, never typed by hand,
so a link can never point at an account the caller has no grant on.
`GET /scans/{id}/link-repo` — the current link, or `null`.
`DELETE /scans/{id}/link-repo` — unlink (ownership-scoped).

### Verification re-run: the live site, not a re-cloned repo

Stage C's `verify.py` re-downloads a repository and re-runs one repo agent — meaningless
for a header finding, whose evidence was always an HTTP response, not a file. Stage D
adds `_rerun_url_agent`, which re-`GET`s `report.url` (the same request `HeadersAgent`
made originally) and reports the observed `ref` as the URL itself, since that's what was
actually re-read. `_resolve_agent`'s blanket refusal of URL-scan agents ("Stage D's job,"
Stage C's own docstring) narrows to exactly the four header finding ids — every other
URL agent (TLS, DNS, subdomains) still has no Fixer, no PR to merge, and stays refused.
Verifying only makes sense once a linked repo's PR has merged (or, per Stage C's
existing "verify by hand" idle affordance, whenever someone wants to re-check), and the
same honest caveat every deployment-adjacent check in this project carries applies here
too: a merged PR is evidence the *file* changed, not proof the site redeployed — the
verification result is what it always was, "we looked," stated as `target_fixed`, never
inflated into a guarantee.

### Verification (this stage's own)

Offline: `detect_stack` against fixture trees (vercel-only, next-only, both, neither);
`SecurityHeaderFixer` for every branch above (happy path per stack, already-fixed,
malformed `vercel.json`, `next.config` with an existing `headers()`, no anchor found);
`validate_plan`'s new branch (accepts a `security-headers` modify at an allowed path,
rejects one at a path outside the table, rejects a plan from any other fixer_slug with
no `file_path` the same as before); `storage/scan_links.py` CRUD; `repo_target`
resolution for both scan types. `TestClient` pass over the three link-repo routes
(ownership, wrong installation, not-a-URL-scan) and a live-linked fix plan/apply/verify
round trip against a fixture Next.js and a fixture Vercel repo. Then, if a real
throwaway site + repo pair is available, one real pass — not reported as working
without it.

**Live-verified 2026-08-13** (seeded session cookie for the real signed-in account,
same pattern Stage B/C used): a real URL scan of `https://example.com` produced all
four header findings; clicking "Check for automatic fix" on `missing-csp` correctly
rendered the link form pre-populated with the real `arihantjaino7` installation (no
typed `owner`); linking to `some-action-v1` — a real repo with neither `vercel.json`
nor `next.config.*` — wrote a real `scan_repo_links` row and then, correctly and
honestly, returned "No automatic fix for this finding" rather than guessing at a
stack; re-checking `missing-hsts` immediately afterward went straight to the same
honest decline with no repeat prompt, confirming the link persists and is reused
across findings on one scan. No throwaway Next.js/Vercel repo exists yet to exercise
the actual patch-writing path live — that remains to be run the same way Stage B's
first real PR was, whenever one is set up. 412 backend tests green (33 new); `tsc
--noEmit` and ESLint clean (the same three pre-existing errors, untouched).
**Note:** `learning/66-linking-a-url-scan-to-its-repository.md` (planned).

## Stage E — the audit browser

**Scoped 2026-08-13**, down from the original one-line deferred note (below) after
three scoping questions confirmed in chat — same discipline as Stage D. The original
note bundled five unrelated things; two of them turned out not to belong on this
roadmap at all:

- **"Revoke UI" is already done.** `app/settings/page.tsx` has a working disconnect
  button wired to `POST /installations/{id}/revoke`, built during Stage B/C's UI
  wiring. The one real gap under this heading — no button anywhere calls
  `unlinkScanRepo()` (Stage D's `DELETE /scans/{id}/link-repo`, plumbed in
  `lib/api.ts` but never wired to a control) — is a small, one-file frontend fix, not
  a stage.
- **The dependency fixer is deferred to its own future stage, not dropped.**
  `agents/repo/dependencies.py` findings carry only `name@version` plus vulnerability
  IDs — no "safe fixed version" field. A real fix would need a package-registry/OSV
  lookup *at apply time*, which is a new kind of network dependency: every existing
  Fixer only ever reads the repo itself. That's real new architecture (which registry
  per ecosystem, what to do with a lockfile, whether a version bump can even be
  expressed as a text diff the way every other Fixer's patch is) and deserves its own
  scoping and conflict-recording pass, not a corner of this one.
- **The DNS piece is dropped from the fixer roadmap entirely, and this is the
  correction:** `subdomain-dangling-dns` is tier 4 ("never auto-fix"), not tier 2 —
  the original deferred note misclassified it. Its remediation is changing a DNS
  record at a registrar, which is outside any repository or pull request this
  project's Fixer contract can express. It was never going to be a Fixer; it stays
  exactly where `tiers.py` already puts it.
- **`secret-env-committed` (a real Tier 2 fixer) and the `netlify.toml`/`nginx.conf`
  header fixers (extending Stage D's `stack.py` to two more targets)** are both still
  plausible, self-contained future stages — just not this one, per the confirmed scope
  below.

**Stage E is scoped to the audit browser alone**: `audit_log` (migration 11, written
since Stage B) has had a `write_audit()` and a `list_audit(scan_id)` since Stage B, but
nothing reads it back except tests — no endpoint, no UI, at any scope wider than "one
scan's rows, fetched directly from storage." CLAUDE.md's remediation rule 10 ("every
write is audited") has been true in the database this whole time and invisible to
everyone but the developer running a query by hand.

**New:** `storage/remediation.py` gains `list_audit_for_user(user_id, limit=...)` —
`audit_log.user_id` is already a column (migration 11), so this is a straight `SELECT
... WHERE user_id = ? ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT ?`, no new table. Two endpoints:
`GET /audit` (this user's recent rows, account-wide — every scan, not just one) and
`GET /scans/{id}/audit` (a thin wrapper over the existing `list_audit`, ownership-
checked the same way `GET /scans/{id}/fix/applications` already is). Each row needs
enough of its scan's context to be legible outside that scan's own page — at minimum
the target URL and a link back to it — so the account-wide endpoint joins `scans` for
`url`/`target_type` rather than returning a bare `scan_id` the frontend would have to
resolve itself.

**Frontend:** a new `/audit` page, linked from the same nav `/settings` already sits
in (`app/scan/[scanId]/layout.tsx`'s per-scan nav gets a matching entry, plus a
top-level link near Settings) — a plain reverse-chronological list: timestamp, action
(`pr_opened`, `pr_merged`, `fix_verified`, `fix_verified_unrecorded`, `pr_failed`,
...), which scan/finding, and the `detail` text already written. No new design system
work — same `glass`/mono-label shapes `/settings` already established.

**Verification:** `list_audit_for_user` offline against a seeded `temp_db` (ordering,
`user_id` scoping — someone else's rows never appear, limit respected); a `TestClient`
pass over both endpoints (401 unauthenticated, 403 on `GET /scans/{id}/audit` for
another user's scan); one live pass reading the real audit history this project has
already accumulated (the Stage B/C real-PR rows, Stage D's live link-repo pass) —
the first time any of it will have been *seen*, not just written.
**Note:** planned, once implemented.

---

## Deferred beyond Stage E — not scoped yet

- `remediation/dependencies.py` — a Tier 2 fixer for `dependency-*` findings. Needs its
  own design pass for the registry-lookup dependency above.
- `remediation/secrets.py` (working name) — a Tier 2 fixer for `secret-env-committed-*`,
  plausibly gitignore-shaped (similar to `GitignoreFixer`) but touching a committed
  secret, so it needs its own read of CLAUDE.md's remediation rule 9 before it's built.
- `netlify.toml` / `nginx.conf` header fixers — extends `remediation/stack.py` and
  `remediation/headers_fix.py`'s `SecurityHeaderFixer` to the two stacks Stage D
  scoped out.
- The small `unlinkScanRepo()` UI wiring gap noted above — a one-file frontend fix
  whenever someone picks it up, not a stage on its own.

`subdomain-dangling-dns` is not on this list. It was on the original one-line Stage E
note and does not belong on any future one either, per the correction above.

The registry and tier table are *designed for* the fixers above; they are not
implemented. Three working fixers beat twenty half-working ones.

(the last only because pinning edits `.github/workflows/*`). Generate a private key, store
the `.pem` outside the repo, put the App ID / slug / client ID / client secret / key path
in `backend/.env` (see `backend/.env.example` for the exact variable names). Never paste
any of them into chat.

Create a throwaway public repo containing a **third-party** GitHub Action, no `.gitignore`,
and a Dockerfile with no `USER` — the Stage B/C test target.

**Done 2026-08-13.** [PR #1](https://github.com/arihantjaino7/some-action-v1/pull/1)
was merged and both findings verified — real numbers in the "definition of
done closed end to end" entry above. Merging was run via `gh pr merge`
against the real repo (`arihantjaino7`'s own account, explicit go-ahead given
in chat); Verify was run against the endpoint directly with a session cookie
minted for the same account, the same shape the UI's own fetch calls use:

```
POST http://localhost:8011/scans/{scan_id}/findings/{finding_key}/verify
```

(For reference, that was scan `959843b8-…`, finding keys `gitignore-present`
and `ci-unpinned-action-.github-workflows-ci.yml-L10`. A 409 means the pull
request hasn't merged yet — the state this section describes until 2026-08-13.)

## Definition of done

1. User scans a repo → 2. a fixable finding appears → 3. user clicks Fix → 4. deterministic
`FixPlan` → 5. exact diff shown → 6. explicit approval → 7. App authorization used →
8. `sentinels/…` branch created → 9. deterministic patch committed → 10. PR created →
11. PR explains the finding, the change, and what it does *not* fix → 12. user merges →
13. responsible agent re-runs → 14. FAIL → PASS → 15. score delta shown → 16. audit row exists.

Files existing is not "implemented".
